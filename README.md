11. Click **Next** to reach **Create**. Review and click

12. Once done. Find and copy the **Public IPv4 address** and save it for later use

    ![drawing](./SS/compute/8.png)

13. To connect to the instance, use one of the following guides based on your environment:<br>
        - [Using Cloud Shell](./SSH/cloud_shell.md) <br>
        - [Using Windows](./SSH/windows.md) <br>
        - [Using Linux](./SSH/linux.md) <br>

## STEP 4 : Create a Block Volume 
### Block volumes are detachable block storage devices that you can use to dynamically expand the storage capacity of an instance.

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Storage**. Under **Block Storage**, click **Block Volumes**

2. Click **Create block volume**

    ![drawing](./SS/block_volume/1.png)

3. Provide the following values: <br>

    ![drawing](./SS/block_volume/4.png)

4. Click **Attach**

5. Once ready. you instance will appear in the list:

    ![drawing](./SS/block_volume/5.png)

6. Connect to the instance by running the following command on your terminal:<br>

        - [Using Windows](./SSH/windows.md) <br>
        - [Using Linux](./SSH/linux.md) <br>

7. Verify that the disk has been successfully attached by executing the following command:
    ```
    sudo lsblk
    ```
    ```⚠️Note: the device name /dev/sdb may differ depending on your setup. Use the output of lsblk to confirm⚠️```
    
    ![drawing](./SS/block_volume/6.png)

8. Format and mount the volume by executing the following commands:
    ```
    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
    sudo mkdir /mnt/data
    sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/data
    ```

9. Run the following command to verify that the disk appears in the list:
    ```
    df -h
    ```

## STEP 5 : Create Dynamic Group and Policies

1. First, make sure you're using the right region - Israel Central (Jerusalem)

   ![drawing](./SS/lab2/1.png)

2. Open the navigation menu and click **Identity & Security** → **Identity** → **Compartments**

3. Select **demo** compartment

4. Copy the full OCID string of **demo** compartment. ⚠️ Save it - you'll need it later ⚠️

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/2.png)

5. Open the navigation menu and click **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, click **Domains**

6. Select **root** compartment, then select the **Default** domain

   ![drawing](./SS/lab2/3.png)

7. Move to **Dynamic groups** tab, then click **Create dynamic group**

      1. **Include instances that match:** Any of the following  
      2. **Match instances with:** Compartment OCID  
      3. **Value:** Enter your compartment OCID  
      4. Click **Add Rule**  

      ![drawing](./SS/lab2/5.png)

   4. The rule should look similar to the following:

      ```
      Any {instance.compartment.id = '<your_compartment_ocid>'}
      ```

    5. Click **Create**

9. Next, we need to give the dynamic group IAM permissions. 
        
10. Select **Policies** on the left menu, then click **Create Policy**

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/6.png)

11. Enter the following:

    3. **Compartment:** root
    4. Switch the **Show manual editor** and add the following policies:

            Allow dynamic-group <your_dg_name> to manage object-family in compartment <your_compartment_name>
    
    5. Click **Create**

    ```⚠️Note: The new policies will go into effect typically within 10 seconds ⚠️```

    5. Leave **Database Configuration** with default values
    6. Set the password for the ADMIN database user in your new database - ⚠️**Don't use @ in password**⚠️
    7. **Access type:** Secure access from allowed IPs and VCNs only
    8. Set **IP notation type:** CIDR block & **Value:** 0.0.0.0/0 - ⚠️**For testing purpose only**⚠️
    9. Skip on the **Contacts** section and click **Create**

4. Wait until your new Autonomous Database's status changes from **Provisioning** to **Available**

5.  Select the **Tool configuration** tab on the Autonomous Database details page

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/11.png)

6. Scroll down the Tool configuration page until you find the **MongoDB API**

8. Copy the connection string under **Public access URL** and edit it as follow: 

    Instead of **[user:password@]** enter your database username and password **(Without the '[]'. With the @)**

    Instead of **[user]** enter your database admin user

    It should looks like: *mongodb://**ADMIN**:**password**@G0D09E...F.adb.il-jerusalem-1.oraclecloudapps.com:27017/**ADMIN**?authMechanism...true*

    ```⚠️Note: Your string name may differ depending on your setup⚠️```

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/12.png)

9. ⚠️ Save the full string - you'll need it later ⚠️

10. Scroll up & Click **Database actions** and then **View all database actions**.

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/13.png)

11. Now, let's add a new collection to your database by clicking &nbsp; **{ } JSON** &nbsp; under the Development section and then **Open**.

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/14.png)

    4. **Destination Port Range:** 5000
    5. Click **Add Ingress Rules**

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/19.png)

8. The newly created rule will be added to the list

    ![drawing](./SS/lab2/20.png)

**STEP 5 : Git Clone**

Use one of below methods to connect to the compute instance you've created earlier today:
    - [Using Cloud Shell](./SSH/cloud_shell.md)
    - [Using Windows](./SSH/windows.md)
    - [Using Linux](./SSH/linux.md)

1. [LINUX/MACOS/Windows] Open your terminal and run:

        ssh  -i <your_ssh_key_full_path>.key opc@<instance_ip>

2. Switch to root user by running the following command:    

        sudo su

3. After you connected to your machine, install git by running the following command:    

        yum install git

4. Now, clone the git repository by running the following command:    

        git clone https://github.com/OCISRAEL/OCIFundamentals-lab01


**STEP 6 : Edit The Config File**

1. Change directory to the cloned folder "OCIFundamentals-lab-01" by running the following command:    

        cd OCIFundamentals-lab-01

2. Run the following command to edit the config file:

        vi flask/config.txt

3. The file will look like that:

        {
        "CONNECTION_STRING": "<DB_CONNECTION_STRING>",
        "bucketName": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
        "coll_name": "<COLLECTION_NAME>"
        }

4. Press on "**i**" key to edit the file and change the following:
    
    1. **"CONNECTION_STRING":** Replace <DB_CONNECTION_STRING> with your **Mongo DB's** connection string (inside the quotation marks)
    2. **"bucketName":** Replace <BUCKET_NAME> with your bucket's name (inside the quotation marks)
    3. **"coll_name":** Replace <COLLECTION_NAME> with your collection's name (inside the quotation marks)

5. After you've finished editing, press the "**esc**" key, then **"shift" + ":"** , then write **:wq** and finally press the "**enter**" key to save your changes


**STEP 7 : Running The Application**

1. Install pip

        sudo yum install -y python3-pip

2. Install all of the packages listed in the "requirements.txt" file:

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the following commands to open port 5000 in the Linux firewall:

    1.      sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5000/tcp
    2.      sudo firewall-cmd --reload

you should get **sucess** on both times

3. Run the following command to run the application:

        python3 flask/OCIFundamentalWorkshop-Instance.py

4. Navigate to the address **http://<your_instance_public_ip>:5000** in your browser and start uploading!


* **If you get the errors "address already in use" or "the server couldnt be started, because another server runs on that port", simply run the following command:**

        sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:5000)


**STEP 8 : Review The Application**

1. Once you have successfully completed all these steps, your web application should look like this:

   ![drawing](./SS/app_ss.png)

2. Upload a test file to the app and confirm it was successful.

3. Check your **bucket**. Do you see the uploaded file?

4. Check your **Autonomous Database** JSON collection. Do you see a new entry?
